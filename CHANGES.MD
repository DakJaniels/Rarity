**r740:**

Additions:
> Added Undermine collectibles to the database
<br>Enabled defeat detection for Queen Ansurek (Reins of the Sureki Skyrazor)
<br>There's now a checkbox to toggle the progress bar that displays tracked items

Changes:
> Rarity once again announces attempts in the chat window by default (instead of the Floating Combat Text)
<br>It's now possible to use the addon's core functionality on WoW Classic realms

Developer Notes:
> If you're using an addon that disables Blizzard's combat text, you might have encountered an issue where announcements weren't being displayed. This could be resolved by explicitly selecting an output channel, but it caused quite some confusion. Rarity is now overriding the LibSink default to ensure its behavior matches expectations. The fallback setting was apparently changed in patch 10.0, but this went unnoticed.
<br>Classic support is very much experimental. Check the known issues on GitHub or Discord and report problems if you find any (spoiler alert: you most definitely will). This effort is driven entirely by the community; if you want to use Rarity on classic servers you must help out in any way you can. Maintaining multiple versions simply isn't going to be possible otherwise.
